In the first test case, I am testing the isHealthy method of the Boa class. I created two Boa objects with different favorite foods, and verify that isHealthy returns true for the first object and false for the second object.

In the second test case, I am testing the fitsInCage method of the Boa class. I created two Boa objects with different lengths, and test whether they fit in cages of different lengths.

For assertTrue(jen.fitsInCage(3)); it will return true because 3 > 2 and for assertFalse(ken.fitsInCage(1)); it will return false because 1 < 3.
